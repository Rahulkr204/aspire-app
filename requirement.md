The project focuses on creating a web application (inspired by the real Aspire application) divided in 2 sections:
1. CSS Challenge:
The candidate should convert the designs into an application with a focus on design fidelity and usage of libraries
and tools aligned with the Code Challenge.
All image assets are exportable directly from the links.
● [Must have] Desktop View: https://xd.adobe.com/view/80c753f2-db2f-4dfc-b6c2-ce39a4c787f0-
d594/screen/7d8639be-16a2-4dc6-9ddc- c3bcd8d8f1ee/
● [Optional] Mobile View: https://xd.adobe.com/view/80c753f2-db2f-4dfc-b6c2-ce39a4c787f0-d594

2. Code Challenge:
The task is to make the UI built with the CSS challenge dynamic and interactive. General notes:
● Application can be built with any tools/libraries (if needed)
● Application should use an API architecture, where dummy data can be returned from the APIs directly within
the code, no real server-side code is required
● The data can be stored in localStorage or state management systems
● At the start up of the application, some cards should be already available
Interactions:
● Add new card:
○ Open a modal where the user can add the card name and submit it. The expiration date and
card number will be randomly generated by the system.
○ The card will be appended in the carousel together with the other cards
● Freeze/Unfreeze card
○ On click of the freeze card, the card will get the frozen status
○ The frozen card will look different from the others (up to the candidate for the look of it can
be a simple semi-transparent opacity value applied)
○ The freeze button will toggle to “unfreeze” for the frozen card
Must have
● Use of TypeScript, with appropriate types/interfaces
● Use of a modern JS framework/libraries (Vue.js/React/Angular/Svelte/Alpine etc.)
● Desktop resolution CSS challenge
● Pixel perfect version of the CSS challenge
● Code optimized for high performance
● Simple and consistent code style, following best practices
● GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab repository url
● Hosted version of the code challenge url (ex. Netlify/Vercel)
● A README.md containing all the information that the reviewers need to run and use the app

Nice to have (optional)
● Responsive version of the CSS challenge (mobile)
● Use of Vue.js 3 with the Quasar framework (as we are using in Aspire) or another CSS
library (ex.Tailwind/Bootstrap/Material etc.)
● Use of any standard UI component library / CSS framework to create some UI components
or elements (e.g. mobile scroll behavior as design, collapsible cards, debit card carousel
etc.)
● Tests
● Form validation
